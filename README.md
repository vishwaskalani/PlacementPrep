# PlacementPrep

## 18th October

- It is midway in the placement processes. Today is 18th October and I think it would be good to log the mistakes and try to improve upon them.

- Unfortunately based on my performance till now, I am uncertain that how the placement season will turn out for me :(

- I have not reflected my preparation in the tests till now. I need to be calm during the tests and try to have my best in whatever time I have. From what I could see, I did not work with my maximum efficiency in the given time frame and have choked in pressure.

- There are plenty of good opportunities ahead. Just focus and practice on your weak points. All will be well :)

## 19th October

- Aah lot of time waste in thinking whether to apply in Sansung Bangalore or not. Finally did not :(

- So many important tests lined up now, Da Vinci, Quadeye, DRW. Let us gear up and put our best efforts for them.

- U don't know what will be asked in Da Vinci, I think would be best to brush up your C++ concepts.
