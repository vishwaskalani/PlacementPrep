# PlacementPrep

## 18th October

- It is midway in the placement processes. Today is 18th October and I think it would be good to log the mistakes and try to improve upon them.

- Unfortunately based on my performance till now, I am uncertain that how the placement season will turn out for me :(

- I have not reflected my preparation in the tests till now. I need to be calm during the tests and try to have my best in whatever time I have. From what I could see, I did not work with my maximum efficiency in the given time frame and have choked in pressure.

- There are plenty of good opportunities ahead. Just focus and practice on your weak points. All will be well :)

## 19th October

- Aah lot of time waste in thinking whether to apply in Samsung Bangalore or not. Finally did not :(

- So many important tests lined up now, Da Vinci, Quadeye, DRW. Let us gear up and put our best efforts for them.

- U don't know what will be asked in Da Vinci, I think would be best to brush up your C++ concepts.

## 20th October

- Important day, da vinci test, be confident, stay calm :) Everything will be well. Will write after coming back as well
- The test of Da Vinvi sde was easier than expected and went well
- But needed to do well in Media.net as well :( but genuinely it was very half hearted attempt
- Played a lot of cricket and foosball today, is fun but still feeling very tired
  

## 21st October

- Quadeye test lined up. Let us see how well can we do in that !!

## 31st October

- Long time no talk
- Hasn't been the happiest of time, there have been huge downfalls in confidence due to some performances in test and probably the worst placement season at IIT Delhi
- But we should now not focus on blamin the placement cell and the situations and should focus on our mistakes and should try to rectify them
- Today we have JPMC test, most probably we would have to write the code in python so will be a bit challenging but that would be the case for everyone so don't worry, be confident, everything will be well, don't stress out, peace :)


## Nov 5

- A lot of things happening, having stripe interview on 6th and Graviton interview on 8th
- Also there is quantbox test today, well it is 1 am in morning and I am struggling to sleep currently.
- Need to think of targets for tomorrow and clearly implement them from morning. Peace :)

## Nov 7

- A busy but some how clumsy behaviour is this phase. You should focus better, had to deal with some BTP work today

- The main and important day is tomorrrow since we have our graviton interview, will try to revise most of the quant problems I have done till now begining from just after nvidia test.
- Let us put our atmost effort till 4 pm tomorrow and believe on god :)

## Nov 8 

- Interview day, so the we have graviton quant interview today, excited and a bit nervous but need to cool down !!

## Nov 17

- Can't say how good or bad were days recently, but unfortunately i did not receive a call for second round of interview with graviton :(
- But we have a jpmc shortlist :), we need to prepare well for the limited interviews that we have now

## Nov 29

- Things are tough, we missed on shortlists of various companies in which we wanted to get into.

Let me list somethings to brushup for today :
