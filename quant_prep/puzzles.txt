https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2973819/a-magic-trick-find-out-the-fifth-card-if-four-is-given

This puzzle says that on chosing 5 cards randomly out of the deck and planning with our teammate, we
can give him 4 cards in such an order that he will be able to guess the 5th card.
For example we can first give the card of the same suit, we must chose the card wisely. Then we have 
an ordering in the cards among suits and their values using permutation of which we encode the value of the
5th card.
