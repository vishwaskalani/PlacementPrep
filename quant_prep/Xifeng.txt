CHESS TOURNAMENT
This problem's second solution on first go might appear to be fully correct but it is very important to understand 
that for any sort of random shuffling of matches in every level, a tournament tree can be constructed.

ALL GIRL WORLD
Expected or infact exactly the number of girls in each family is 1
Expected number of boys in each family is
1/2*1/2*1 + 1/2*1/2*1/2*3 + ..................
Use harmonic series method to solve it
U will get this as 1
So expected ratio of boys and girls is 1/2

CANDIES IN A JAR
10 Red, 20 Blue, 30 green candies and we need thw chance that atleast one Blue
and one green candy is left when all red candies are over
The basic idea is to have an index of last picked candies of different colours

tr<tb<tg and tr<tg<tb

then consider the probabilities of these expressions

COIN TOSS GAME

HT subsequence appears and we get our winner
p(a), p(b) = 1-p(a)
p(a) = 0.5*p(a|h)+0.5*p(a|t)
p(a|t) = 1- p(a)
p(a|h) = 0.5*0 + 0.5*(1-p(a|h))
p(a|h) = 1/3
p(a) = 4/9

RUSSIAN ROULETTE SERIES 

Simply once rolling the roulette and then going turn by turn has 0.5 probability of each person losing

If u consider turn by turn probabilities then also u can reach the right result

p(a) = p(1st)+p(3rd)+p(5th)
p(3rd) = 1/4 (this is incorrect)
actually p(3rd | not first and not second) = 1/4

now u will get the same answer

If u have random shuffling after each turn then simple recursive equation works

p = 1/6 + 5/6 (1-p)

BASKETBALL SCORES

The probability of scoring exactly k baskets in n throws can be found using a recursive equation

p(k,n+1) = p(k,n) *(1-(k/n)) + p(k-1,n)*((k-1)/n)

CARS ON A ROAD

Let the probability of seeing a car in 5 minute interval be p

Now the probability of seeing a car in 20 mins is

1 - (1-p)^4 = p'

Now u can calculate p in terms of p'

MEETING PROBABILITY 

This is a simple problem 
We have X,Y ranging from 0 to 60 and we need |X-Y|<5 for meeting which is simply a geometric probability problem

PROBABILITY OF TRIANGLE

This is a very popular problem
x,y-x,1-y three segments , write triangular condition and plot the lines

ans = 1/4
