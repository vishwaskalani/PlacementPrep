3) A fantastic card guessing puzzle 
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2973819/a-magic-trick-find-out-the-fifth-card-if-four-is-given

This puzzle says that on chosing 5 cards randomly out of the deck and planning with our teammate, we
can give him 4 cards in such an order that he will be able to guess the 5th card.
For example we can first give the card of the same suit, we must chose the card wisely. Then we have 
an ordering in the cards among suits and their values using permutation of which we encode the value of the
5th card.

4) Remember gambler's ruin general formula

5)Covariance and correlation formula,  you must Remember, good q for revision
Cov(X,Y) = E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]

correlation = Cov(X,Y)/sqrt(var(X),var(Y))

Think on variance of indicator variable as E(Ia^2)-(E(Ia))^2


6) Very important question
https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clhudgg8s001emm08lfxy5oab

Based on the recursive equation
P(x,y) = ((x-1)/(y-1))*P(x-1,y-1) + (1 - (x/(y-1)))*P(x,y-1)

Then based on induction argue that the answer of P(x,y) = 1/(y-1)
so answer is 1/99
