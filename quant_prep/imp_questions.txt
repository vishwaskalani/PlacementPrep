3) A fantastic card guessing puzzle 
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2973819/a-magic-trick-find-out-the-fifth-card-if-four-is-given

This puzzle says that on chosing 5 cards randomly out of the deck and planning with our teammate, we
can give him 4 cards in such an order that he will be able to guess the 5th card.
For example we can first give the card of the same suit, we must chose the card wisely. Then we have 
an ordering in the cards among suits and their values using permutation of which we encode the value of the
5th card.

4) Remember gambler's ruin general formula

5)Covariance and correlation formula,  you must Remember, good q for revision
Cov(X,Y) = E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]

correlation = Cov(X,Y)/sqrt(var(X),var(Y))
https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clhudgax8000smm08fc0ukkge

Think on variance of indicator variable as E(Ia^2)-(E(Ia))^2


6) Very important question
https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clhudgg8s001emm08lfxy5oab

Based on the recursive equation
P(x,y) = ((x-1)/(y-1))*P(x-1,y-1) + (1 - (x/(y-1)))*P(x,y-1)

Then based on induction argue that the answer of P(x,y) = 1/(y-1)
so answer is 1/99

7) Very interesting problem, based on dividing in two grps with increasing subsequences
https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clhrexqs30002l608jui31ony

consider 2,3,4,5,6,7
We have to make two grps out of it. Number of ways is 6C0+6C1+.... = 2^6
Out of those ways when our second grp is the suffix of this sequence, then we have no left turn
therefore let us remove those cases which are 7. So we get total 2^6-7 = 57 ways

8) Important noodle connecting problem, expectation is tough, probability is easy
https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clgfh6h43000ala08lo8diig6

9) Very easy but important problem, coupon collector problem based on geometric probability
The problem is the expected number of turns in which we would have collected all the coupons
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem
think of an event having success probability p and failure probability 1-p, then the expected number of turns for success is:
e = p +(1-p)(1+e) and u will get e = 1/p
now think of coupon collection as t = t1+t2+..ti...
where ti is the event of collecting ith coupon when u have collected i-1 coupons
therefore the answer comes out to be n(1+1/2+1/3....) ~ nlogn

Another important aspect in this problem is the expected number of distinct coupons in n turns
https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clhudgbdf000umm088tmngvt4
again breaking the random variable and utilizing the sum of expectations theorem
this is same as this problem

10) Random ants problem
https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clhudg9eo000mmm08opjz067x
In this problem the answer is n/(n+1)
First figure out that collision has no effect
Then we need to find the expected value of the longest distance of an ant from an end
This is a standard probability problem
X1,x2...xN all less than x...then cdf = x^n and the pdf is nx^n-1 and then find the expected value using integration

11)Color switches problem
https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clgfh6vh0001ola086n74y011
This is a tricky problem where we need to conclude that all the expectations are equivalent.
I would say calculate the answer for 1 white, 1 black and 2 white and 2 black and conclude the answer to be 50%

12) Keep in mind the deifinition of cdf, maximum is straightfwd, minimum is tricky

13) Very standard set of problems of whether to stop or roll
https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clhros2s0000kmv08kjh6oqo8
The series is like 7/2, 17/4, 14/3....

14) Important die rolling sum problem, arguement by induction, not possible using the most intutitive recursion, this recursion needed
Important that the sum is n for a n sided die
https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clhros624000ymv08941z69mq

15)https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clj338ssd0000mf08x63ie7lx
expected turns to find the a taller guy is infinite
uses the fact that e(n) = e(e(n|x))

16) https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clgfh6o3l000ola08ygac9sta
This problem utilizes an interesting result on inequalities and then uses induction
Very important for interviews but not as such for tests

17)https://www.puzzledquant.com/problems/clhudgreo002kmm08ht81csnn
The most confusing thing about this problem is that we tend to look into modulo 2 results rather than modulo 3 results
There is no way you can do it just by using the parity of even and odd. At any point of time, two numbers won't have the same modulo 3

21) Very important, must know the probability of 2 random chords intersecting in a circle is 1/3,
consider 4 points and then consider 1 out of three case to have intersection
This problem also requires considering pairs of non adjancent chords
