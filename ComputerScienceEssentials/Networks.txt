1) Packet switching vs circuit switching
circuit switching is under utilization of resources
2) Packet delay  = d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop
    d_proc = nodal processing, checking bit errors etc
    d_queue = time waiting at the output link
    d_trans = transmitting to the link = L/R where we have L bits packet and R as the transmitting rate in bits/s 
    d_prop = time taken by the packet to propogate to the end point, equal to d/prop_speed
3) Traffic intensity at a link is La/R where a is the arrival rates of the packets
4) The Internet protocol stack is organized into layers, including application, transport, network, link, and physical layers.
5) Each layer serves specific functions and utilizes the services of the layer below it.
6) The application layer supports network applications like HTTP, IMAP, SMTP, and DNS.
7) The transport layer manages process-to-process data transfer using protocols like TCP and UDP.
8) The network layer handles routing of datagrams from source to destination using IP and routing protocols.
9) The link layer facilitates data transfer between neighboring network elements, employing technologies like Ethernet, 802.11, and PPP.
10) The physical layer deals with the actual transmission of bits over the wire.
11) Layering involves encapsulation of data, where each layer adds its header to create a segment or datagram, with specific headers used to implement respective services.

	application layer message + transport layer header = transport layer segment
	transport layer segment + network layer header = network layer datagram
	network layer datagram + link layer header = link layer frame

12) Application layer process identification is using the ip address of the host as well as the port number.
	For example http server port number 80, mail serever port number 25
13) Transport protocol services important aspects :
	TCP : Reliable transport,flow control, congestion control,connection oriented,doesn't provide timing, throughput guarantee, security
	UDP : Unreliable data transfer, doesn't provide congestion control
14) Some common internet applications : 
	file transfer - FTP - TCP
	email - SMTP -TCP
	Web documents -HTTP - TCP
	Internet Telephony - SIP/RTP - TCP/UDP (SIP - Session initiation protocol, RTP- Real time transport protocol)
	Streaming audio/vido - HTTP/DASH - TCP/UDP
	Interactive games - WOW/FPS - UDP/TCP
15) We have persistent and non persistent http, in persistent http, we have mutlitple object tranfer using a single connection
16) Non persistent http response time = 2*RTT + File transmission time
